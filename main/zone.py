can make you do stupid things. Like board a creaky dirty old ship at 9pm on a Thursday evening. A Thursday 
evening that seemed intent on levying some kind of storm upon all of us. I should be home drinking. Instead Iâ€™m 
here on the deck of a ship heading toward the thunder. Suffice is to say this gig came up last minute and the 
paycheck is insane. Some money people want me to get control of this  island. Some kind of manufacturing 
facility. The dossier here has the details. For this kind of money, I'm more than willing to oblige. Seems easy 
enough. However I'm a firm believer that  if its too good to be true it probably is. It's looking like  we're

The Client: Venture Capital Consortium. This is big money

The Job: Our Client has put significant money into this 
small upstart Pharma company. I couldn't get much info on the company. It all looks pretty hush 
hush. What I could gather from the Client is that the company produces some kind of experimental 
pharmaceutical. The production facility is on a small Caribbean island I'd never heard of. 
Our client has lost contact with the island. Seems all communication has been cut off. Sounds like 
before things went dark there had been some drama related to unauthorized use of the pharmaceutical.
Your mission if you choose to accept it. You'd better accept it. For this kind of money you'd be 
crazy not to. In any case the ask is simple. Restore communications to the island and return with 
information as to what the hell is going on.""",
